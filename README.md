## Examples

### Socket.IO

* [PoseNet]() 
![](images/posenet.png)

This is a simple implementation of [OpenRNDR](http://https://openrndr.org) rendering the results outputted by the [PoseNet model](https://github.com/runwayml/processing/blob/master/posenet/posenet.pde). It uses Socket.IO to listen for emitted events and renders the ensuing implemented poses, similar to the [Processing.org implementation](https://github.com/runwayml/processing).  

* [Face Detection]()

Similiarly, this is a implementation of rendering the results outputted by the [Face Landmarks model](https://github.com/runwayml/processing/blob/master/posenet/posenet.pde), part of Davis E. King's dlib library. It again uses SocketIO to listen for emitted events and renders the faces.
